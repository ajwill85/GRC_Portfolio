- [ ] Lambda function `VulnerabilityScoring` is deployed and operational
- [ ] Function has appropriate IAM permissions
- [ ] Function correctly implements:
  - [ ] CVSS score calculation
  - [ ] Business impact assessment
  - [ ] Total risk score calculation
  - [ ] Risk level determination

### Data Storage and Notifications
- [ ] DynamoDB table `VulnerabilityScoring` exists and is accessible
- [ ] Critical and high-risk vulnerabilities trigger SNS notifications
- [ ] Vulnerability records include:
  - [ ] Vulnerability ID
  - [ ] CVSS score
  - [ ] Business impact score
  - [ ] Total score
  - [ ] Risk level
  - [ ] Timestamp

## Module 5: Risk Dashboards and Reporting

### CloudWatch Dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard `RiskAssessmentDashboard` is created
- [ ] Dashboard includes widgets for:
  - [ ] Lambda function invocations
  - [ ] DynamoDB usage metrics
- [ ] Metrics are updating correctly

### Automated Reporting

- [ ] All data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] All communications use TLS

### Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] High-risk findings generate immediate notifications
- [ ] Daily reports are delivered successfully
- [ ] Dashboard metrics are populated
- [ ] Error conditions are properly logged
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms are configured for critical components

## Cleanup Validation

After completing the lab cleanup, verify that all resources have been properly deleted:

### AWS Resources
- [ ] All Lambda functions are deleted
- [ ] All IAM roles and policies are deleted
- [ ] All DynamoDB tables are deleted
- [ ] All S3 buckets are emptied and deleted
- [ ] All EventBridge rules are deleted
- [ ] CloudWatch dashboard is deleted
- [ ] SNS topics are deleted

### Verification
- [ ] No orphaned resources remain

## Next Steps

After completing this validation checklist, consider:

1. Implementing additional security controls based on findings
2. Expanding the threat modeling to cover more AWS services
3. Enhancing the reporting with additional metrics
4. Integrating with other security tools and frameworks
5. Documenting lessons learned and areas for improvement
