# Lab 7: Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling

## Overview

This lab focuses on implementing risk assessment methodologies and threat modeling techniques specific to AWS environments. You will learn how to identify, analyze, and prioritize potential security threats, conduct service-specific risk assessments, and create visualization tools for risk reporting and management.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Apply structured threat modeling methodologies to AWS architectures
2. Conduct comprehensive risk assessments for AWS services and workloads
3. Integrate with AWS Trusted Advisor for automated risk identification
4. Implement vulnerability prioritization frameworks
5. Create effective risk dashboards and reporting mechanisms
6. Develop workflows for continuous risk assessment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have:

- An AWS account with administrative access
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Basic understanding of AWS services and security concepts
- Familiarity with security risk assessment concepts
- Completed Lab 1: AWS Account Governance (recommended)
- Completed Lab 2: Identity and Access Management (recommended)

## Estimated Time and Cost

- **Time to complete**: 3-4 hours
- **AWS cost**: $5-10 if resources are promptly cleaned up after the lab
  - Most resources are eligible for AWS Free Tier
  - Some components like AWS Security Hub and Config may incur small charges

## Architecture Overview

This lab will guide you through building a risk assessment and threat modeling framework that includes:

- Threat modeling templates and methodology for AWS workloads
- Risk assessment workflows for AWS services
- Integration with AWS Trusted Advisor and Security Hub
- Automated risk scoring and prioritization system
- Risk visualization dashboards and reporting

See the [architecture diagram](architecture-diagram.md) for a visual representation of the solution.

## Modules

The lab is divided into five modules:

1. **Module 1: AWS Threat Modeling Methodology** - Establish a threat modeling approach for AWS environments
2. **Module 2: Service-Specific Risk Assessments** - Conduct detailed risk assessments for key AWS services
3. **Module 3: AWS Trusted Advisor Integration** - Leverage AWS Trusted Advisor for risk identification
4. **Module 4: Vulnerability Prioritization** - Implement a vulnerability scoring and prioritization system
5. **Module 5: Risk Dashboards and Reporting** - Create effective risk visualization and reporting mechanisms

Follow the [step-by-step guide](step-by-step-guide.md) to complete each module.

## Validation

After completing the lab, use the [validation checklist](validation-checklist.md) to verify your implementation meets all requirements.

## Advanced Challenges

Once you've completed the main lab, try the [advanced challenges](challenges.md) to further enhance your skills.

## Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges, make sure to delete all resources created during this lab by following the cleanup instructions at the end of the step-by-step guide.
