# Lab 3: Security Automation with Infrastructure as Code - Advanced Challenges

These advanced challenges are designed to test your understanding of security automation principles and extend the skills learned in the main lab. Each challenge builds on the core concepts and encourages you to explore more complex security automation scenarios.

## Challenge 1: Multi-Account Security Baseline

**Objective**: Extend your security automation to work across multiple AWS accounts using AWS Organizations.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a CloudFormation StackSet that can deploy your security baseline across multiple accounts
2. Implement a service control policy (SCP) that enforces security guardrails at the organization level
3. Create a centralized security dashboard that displays compliance status across all accounts
4. Implement a cross-account remediation workflow using AWS Systems Manager Automation

**Success Criteria**:
- Security baseline can be deployed to multiple accounts with a single operation
- SCPs prevent unauthorized modifications to security controls
- Security findings from all accounts are visible in a centralized dashboard
- Remediation actions can be executed across account boundaries

## Challenge 2: Enhance Your CI/CD Pipeline with Custom Security Checks

**Objective**: Add custom security checks to your CI/CD pipeline that go beyond the standard tools like cfn-nag.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a custom CodeBuild step that checks for compliance with your organization's specific security policies
2. Implement a custom pre-deployment validation step that checks for security issues in application-specific resources (e.g., check API Gateway for proper authorization)
3. Add dynamic security testing using tools like OWASP ZAP to test deployed resources
4. Create a custom security scoring system that factors in multiple security checks and only allows deployment if a minimum score is achieved

**Success Criteria**:
- Custom security checks are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline
- Pipeline prevents deployment of resources that don't meet security requirements
- Security testing is automated and integrated into the deployment process
- Security scoring provides a quantitative measure of deployment security

## Challenge 3: Event-Driven Security Response

**Objective**: Implement an event-driven security response system that automatically reacts to security events.

**Tasks**:
1. Create an EventBridge rule that monitors for security-related events (e.g., GuardDuty findings, AWS Config rule noncompliance, Security Hub findings)
2. Implement a Step Functions workflow that orchestrates the response to security events, including investigation, containment, and remediation steps
3. Add a notification system that alerts security teams with appropriate severity levels
4. Implement a feedback loop that captures the effectiveness of automated responses and adjusts accordingly

**Success Criteria**:
- System automatically detects and responds to security events
- Response workflow includes appropriate investigation and containment steps
- Security teams are notified based on event severity
- System captures metrics on response effectiveness

## Challenge 4: Secure by Default Resource Templates

**Objective**: Create a library of secure-by-default resource templates that implement security best practices.

**Tasks**:
1. Create CloudFormation and/or Terraform modules for common resource types (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.) with security best practices built-in
2. Implement a validation system that ensures templates aren't modified to remove security controls
3. Create a documentation system that explains the security features of each template
4. Implement a versioning and update system that allows templates to be updated as security best practices evolve

**Success Criteria**:
- Templates implement all relevant security best practices for each resource type
- Validation system prevents deployment of modified templates that remove security controls
- Documentation clearly explains security features and their purpose
- Templates can be updated as security best practices evolve

## Challenge 5: Security Regression Testing

**Objective**: Implement a system to prevent security regressions in your infrastructure.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a baseline security assessment of your infrastructure
2. Implement automated security tests that run regularly to detect changes from the baseline
3. Create a notification system that alerts when security regressions are detected
4. Implement a rollback mechanism that can restore security controls if regressions are detected

**Success Criteria**:
- Security baseline accurately reflects the desired security state
- Automated tests detect deviations from the baseline
- Notifications are sent when regressions are detected
- Rollback mechanism successfully restores security controls

## Challenge 6: Advanced Policy as Code Implementation

**Objective**: Implement a sophisticated policy as code framework that enforces security policies across your infrastructure.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a comprehensive set of policy rules using tools like OPA (Open Policy Agent), CloudFormation Guard, or custom scripts
2. Implement a policy evaluation engine that can evaluate resources against policy rules
3. Create a policy management system that allows policies to be updated and versioned
4. Implement policy inheritance and overrides for different environments (dev, test, prod)

**Success Criteria**:
- Policy rules cover all critical security requirements
- Policy evaluation engine accurately identifies policy violations
- Policies can be updated and versioned without disrupting existing resources
- Policy inheritance and overrides work correctly for different environments

## Challenge 7: Infrastructure Drift Detection and Remediation

**Objective**: Create a system to detect and remediate drift from secure infrastructure configurations.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement a drift detection mechanism using AWS Config or custom tooling
2. Create automated remediation workflows that correct drift when detected
3. Implement a notification system that alerts when drift is detected and remediated
4. Add a reporting system that tracks drift over time and identifies patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- Drift detection accurately identifies changes from desired state
- Remediation workflows correctly restore desired state
- Notifications provide appropriate information about drift and remediation
- Reporting system tracks drift patterns and helps identify recurring issues

## Challenge 8: Security Chaos Engineering

**Objective**: Implement security chaos engineering to proactively identify weaknesses in your security automation.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a framework for running controlled security chaos experiments
2. Implement experiments that test your security automation's response to various scenarios (e.g., deliberate security group modification, IAM policy changes)
3. Add instrumentation to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of your security controls
4. Create a feedback mechanism to improve security controls based on experiment results

**Success Criteria**:
- Chaos experiments safely test security controls
- Experiments provide meaningful insights into security automation effectiveness
- Instrumentation accurately measures security control performance
- Security controls are improved based on experiment feedback

## Submission Guidelines

For each challenge you complete:

1. Document your solution, including:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Code snippets or repository links
   - Description of your approach
   - Explanation of security principles applied

2. Provide evidence of successful implementation, such as:
   - Screenshots of dashboards, pipeline runs, or notifications
   - Logs showing automated remediation
   - Test results
   - Metrics on effectiveness

3. Include a reflection on what you learned and how you would improve your solution with more time or resources.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solutions will be evaluated based on:

1. **Effectiveness**: Does the solution successfully address the challenge requirements?
