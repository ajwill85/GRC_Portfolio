# Lab 2: Security Controls as Code - Assessment Worksheet

Use this worksheet to evaluate and document your implementation of baseline AWS security controls as code. This will help you reflect on your work, gather evidence for your GRC portfolio, and prepare for interviews or professional reviews.

## Implementation Assessment

### Baseline Security Controls
Check off each control as you verify its implementation:

| Security Control | Implemented | Notes/Evidence |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Principle of Least Privilege | □ | |
| Network Segmentation (VPC, SGs, NACLs) | □ | |
| Logging (S3 Access Logs) | □ | |
| S3 Bucket with Encryption/Public Access Block | □ | |
| IAM Role with Least Privilege | □ | |
| Monitoring/Alerting (CloudWatch, Security Hub) | □ | |
| No Hardcoded Secrets (Secrets Manager/SSM) | □ | |
| Resource Tagging | □ | |
| Encryption at Rest | □ | |
| Encryption in Transit | □ | |

### CloudFormation Resource Inventory
List the CloudFormation resources you deployed and their status:

| Resource Logical ID | Resource Type | Status | Notes |
|---------------------|--------------|--------|-------|
|                     |              |        |       |
|                     |              |        |       |
|                     |              |        |       |

### Evidence & Validation
- Screenshots or CLI output showing deployed resources
- Validation checklist results
- Security Hub/Config findings (if enabled)

## Reflection
- How do these controls help address GRC requirements in real-world AWS environments?
- What challenges did you encounter, and how did you resolve them?
- What would you do differently for a production or organizational deployment?
- What AWS documentation or resources were most helpful?

## Next Steps
- What additional controls or improvements would you add if you had more time?
- How will you showcase this work in your professional portfolio?
