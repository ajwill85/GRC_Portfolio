# Architecture Diagram: Security Controls as Code

Use this section to create a detailed diagram of your lab environment, showing all key AWS resources and security controls. A robust diagram will help you communicate your design to employers or reviewers.

## Example Diagram Elements
- AWS Account boundary
- VPC with subnets (public/private)
- Security Groups and NACLs
- S3 bucket with access controls, encryption, and public access block
- IAM role (least privilege, S3 read-only)
- CloudWatch for monitoring/alerting
- Security Hub integration
- IAM roles/policies for least privilege
- Flow logs or other logging mechanisms
- (Optional) AWS Config, SNS topics, or other relevant services

## Diagram Submission
- Use diagramming tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or AWS Architecture Icons
- Include the diagram here as an image, or provide a link to an external diagram
- Annotate your diagram to highlight security controls and data flows

## Diagram Reflection
- What are the key security boundaries?
- How do controls interact to protect resources?
- Where would you improve or extend the design?

A detailed, annotated diagram will strengthen your GRC portfolio. Consider including screenshots, architecture files, or additional notes as needed.
