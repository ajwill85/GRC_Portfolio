# Lab 1: AWS Account Governance - Open-Ended Challenges

These open-ended challenges are designed to help you apply your knowledge in more creative ways beyond the structured lab exercises. There are no fixed "correct" answers - the goal is to demonstrate your understanding of AWS security concepts by designing innovative solutions.

## Challenge 1: Design a Custom Security Dashboard

**Objective**: Create a custom dashboard that provides real-time visibility into your AWS account security posture.

**Context**: The CIO of your organization wants a simplified way to understand the current security status without diving into multiple AWS consoles.

**Requirements**:
- Must visually represent key security metrics and compliance status
- Should provide trend data over time
- Must include a way to quickly identify the highest priority issues

**Possible Approaches**:
- Use CloudWatch dashboards with custom widgets
- Create a QuickSight dashboard with Security Hub data
- Design a custom web application using the AWS SDK
- Use a third-party dashboard tool integrated with AWS

**Deliverable**: 
Design document with dashboard mockups, implementation approach, and explanation of how the dashboard helps security stakeholders make decisions.

## Challenge 2: Develop a Security Incident Response Plan

**Objective**: Create a comprehensive incident response plan for AWS security events.

**Context**: Your security team needs clear procedures for responding to different types of security incidents detected through your new security controls.

**Requirements**:
- Define specific playbooks for at least 3 types of security incidents
- Include roles and responsibilities for different team members
- Document communication protocols during an incident
- Incorporate AWS tools for investigation and remediation

**Example Incidents**:
- Unauthorized root account access
- S3 bucket exposure
- Unusual IAM activity
- Potential data exfiltration
- Compromised EC2 instance

**Deliverable**:
Incident response plan document with detailed playbooks, communication templates, and automated remediation steps where possible.

## Challenge 3: Security Architecture for a Specific Industry

**Objective**: Adapt the account governance controls for a specific industry with unique compliance requirements.

**Context**: Choose one of the following industries and design an enhanced version of the security architecture:
- Healthcare (HIPAA)
- Financial Services (PCI DSS, SOX)
- Government (FedRAMP, FISMA)
- Education (FERPA)
- Retail (PCI DSS)

**Requirements**:
- Identify specific compliance controls relevant to your chosen industry
- Enhance the basic architecture to address industry-specific threats
- Document additional AWS services needed for compliance
- Create a mapping between AWS controls and compliance requirements

**Deliverable**:
Enhanced architecture diagram, compliance mapping document, and implementation guide for the industry-specific controls.

## Challenge 4: Multi-Account Security Strategy

**Objective**: Design a security architecture spanning multiple AWS accounts.

**Context**: Your organization is planning to scale from a single AWS account to a multi-account structure following AWS best practices.

**Requirements**:
- Design an AWS Organizations structure with appropriate organizational units
- Define Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce security guardrails
- Plan for centralized security monitoring across accounts
- Document identity management and cross-account access strategy

**Deliverable**:
Multi-account architecture diagram, SCP examples, security tooling configuration plan, and implementation roadmap.

## Challenge 5: Security Automation and DevSecOps Integration

**Objective**: Design a strategy to integrate security controls into your CI/CD pipeline.

**Context**: Your development team is adopting DevOps practices and wants to integrate security into their CI/CD pipeline to achieve DevSecOps.

**Requirements**:
- Identify appropriate security checks for different stages of the pipeline
- Design automated compliance verification before deployment
- Implement infrastructure-as-code security scanning
- Create a feedback loop for developers to address security issues

**Deliverable**:
DevSecOps process flow, CI/CD pipeline configuration examples, and implementation guide with code samples for security checks.

## Challenge 6: "Purple Team" Exercise Design

**Objective**: Design a "purple team" exercise to test the effectiveness of your security controls.

**Context**: Your security team wants to validate that the implemented controls actually work effectively by conducting an internal security exercise.

**Requirements**:
- Design scenarios to test each major security control
- Create a methodology for safely simulating attacks
- Develop a scoring system to evaluate security effectiveness
- Plan a process to remediate any issues found during testing

**Deliverable**:
Purple team exercise playbook with detailed testing scenarios, safety precautions, evaluation criteria, and reporting templates.

## Submission Guidelines

For each challenge you choose to complete:

1. Document your solution approach and design decisions
2. Include architecture diagrams where appropriate
3. Provide implementation guidance with specific AWS service configurations
4. Explain the security benefits of your approach
5. Identify any limitations or assumptions in your solution

Remember, these challenges are deliberately open-ended to encourage creative thinking. Focus on demonstrating your understanding of AWS security principles rather than finding a single "correct" answer.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solutions will be most valuable if they demonstrate:

- Deep understanding of AWS security services and their capabilities
- Thoughtful application of security principles
- Practical implementation considerations
- Clear communication of technical concepts
- Awareness of security tradeoffs and limitations
