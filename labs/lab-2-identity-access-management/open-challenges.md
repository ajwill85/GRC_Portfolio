# Lab 2: Identity and Access Management - Open-Ended Challenges

These open-ended challenges are designed to help you apply your IAM knowledge in more creative ways beyond the structured lab exercises. There are no fixed "correct" answers - the goal is to demonstrate your understanding of AWS identity and access management by designing innovative solutions.

## Challenge 1: Design a Just-In-Time Access System

**Objective**: Create a solution that grants temporary elevated privileges to users only when they need them, for the duration they need them.

**Context**: Your company wants to eliminate standing privileges for administrators and instead implement a just-in-time access model where elevated access is granted temporarily and automatically revoked.

**Requirements**:
- Must provide a way for users to request elevated access
- Should include an approval workflow for sensitive operations
- Must automatically revoke access after a specified time period
- Should log all privilege escalation events
- Must provide audit trails of actions taken during elevated access sessions

**Possible Approaches**:
- Use AWS Lambda and Step Functions to orchestrate the workflow
- Implement with IAM roles and dynamic trust policies
- Create a UI for access requests using API Gateway and a web application
- Use AWS CloudWatch Events for automatic revocation

**Deliverable**: 
Design document with architecture diagrams, implementation approach, and security considerations.

## Challenge 2: Develop an IAM Governance Framework

**Objective**: Create a comprehensive governance framework for managing IAM permissions across a multi-account AWS environment.

**Context**: As your organization grows, maintaining consistent IAM practices across multiple AWS accounts becomes increasingly difficult. You need a framework to ensure consistent controls, monitoring, and compliance.

**Requirements**:
- Define standards for IAM roles, policies, and groups
- Create a method for centralizing IAM management
- Design processes for access reviews and certification
- Establish monitoring and alerting for IAM policy violations
- Include remediation workflows for non-compliant resources

**Example Components**:
- Account baseline templates with mandatory IAM controls
- Centralized IAM policy repository and version control
- Automated compliance checking
- Access review and certification workflow
- Emergency access processes

**Deliverable**:
Governance framework document with implementation approach, operational procedures, and example templates.

## Challenge 3: Identity Strategy for a Merger/Acquisition

**Objective**: Design an identity strategy to securely integrate AWS resources from an acquired company.

**Context**: Your company has acquired another organization that uses AWS. You need to integrate their AWS accounts, users, and resources into your existing AWS environment while maintaining security and minimizing disruption.

**Requirements**:
- Assess current IAM practices in both organizations
- Define an integration strategy with clear phases
- Handle potentially conflicting IAM naming conventions and policies
- Ensure continuous access to critical systems during transition
- Implement proper security controls throughout the process

**Considerations**:
- Directory services integration
- Cross-account access
- Resource sharing between accounts
- Consolidation vs. segregation of accounts
- Training and communication plans

**Deliverable**:
Integration strategy document with timeline, technical approach, and risk mitigation plan.

## Challenge 4: Zero Trust Architecture for AWS Access

**Objective**: Design a Zero Trust architecture for AWS access that verifies every user and every request before granting access.

**Context**: Your organization wants to move beyond the traditional perimeter-based security model to a Zero Trust approach for AWS access.

**Requirements**:
- Implement least privilege access for all users and services
- Verify identity, device health, and network location for every access request
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Log and analyze all access requests and activities
- Design for resilience and user experience

**Possible Approaches**:
- Use AWS IAM Identity Center with contextual access policies
- Implement step-up authentication for sensitive operations
- Create dynamic access policies based on risk scoring
- Deploy continuous validation and monitoring
- Leverage AWS Control Tower and Service Control Policies

**Deliverable**:
Architecture design document with implementation roadmap, security controls, and operational considerations.

## Challenge 5: IAM for Multi-Cloud Strategy

**Objective**: Design an identity and access management strategy that works across AWS and other cloud providers.

**Context**: Your organization is pursuing a multi-cloud strategy and needs a coherent approach to managing identities and access across AWS, Azure, and/or Google Cloud.

**Requirements**:
- Single source of truth for identities
- Consistent access control policies across clouds
- Unified access review and governance
- Seamless user experience
- Centralized auditing and monitoring

**Possible Approaches**:
- Federated identity with an external IdP (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- Implementing consistent RBAC across cloud providers
- Creating a unified access request and provisioning workflow
- Developing cross-cloud monitoring and alerting
- Using an abstraction layer for policy management

**Deliverable**:
Strategy document with architecture diagrams, implementation approach, and operational considerations.

## Challenge 6: Secure Machine-to-Machine Authentication Design

**Objective**: Design a secure system for machine-to-machine authentication and authorization in an AWS environment.

**Context**: Your organization is moving toward a microservices architecture with hundreds of services that need to communicate securely with one another across multiple AWS accounts.

**Requirements**:
- Secure service-to-service authentication
- Dynamic secret management
- Fine-grained authorization between services
- Ability to audit service-to-service communication
- Automated rotation of credentials
- Minimal performance impact

**Possible Approaches**:
- IAM roles for Amazon ECS/EKS tasks and services
- AWS Certificate Manager Private CA for mutual TLS
- AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation
- Service mesh implementations with identity-aware proxies
- Custom authorization service with JWT tokens

**Deliverable**:
Design document with security analysis, implementation approach, and operational guidelines.

## Submission Guidelines

For each challenge you choose to complete:

1. Document your solution approach and design decisions
2. Include architecture diagrams where appropriate
3. Provide implementation guidance with specific AWS service configurations
4. Explain the security benefits of your approach
5. Identify any limitations or assumptions in your solution

Remember, these challenges are deliberately open-ended to encourage creative thinking. Focus on demonstrating your understanding of IAM principles rather than finding a single "correct" answer.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solutions will be most valuable if they demonstrate:

- Deep understanding of AWS IAM services and their capabilities
- Thoughtful application of security principles like least privilege
- Practical implementation considerations
- Clear communication of technical concepts
- Awareness of security tradeoffs and limitations
