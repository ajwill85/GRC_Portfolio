# Lab 2: Identity and Access Management - Assessment Worksheet

Use this worksheet to evaluate your implementation of AWS Identity and Access Management and reflect on your experience. This will help you document your work for your GRC portfolio.

## Implementation Assessment

### Core IAM Controls

Check off each control as you verify its implementation:

| Security Control | Implemented | Notes/Evidence |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| IAM Password Policy | □ | |
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | □ | |
| RBAC with Custom IAM Groups | □ | |
| IAM Roles with Least Privilege | □ | |
| Custom IAM Policies | □ | |
| Permission Boundaries | □ | |
| Service Control Policies (if using Organizations) | □ | |
| Identity Federation | □ | |
| IAM Access Analyzer | □ | |
| CloudTrail Monitoring for IAM Activities | □ | |
| CloudWatch Alarms for IAM Events | □ | |
| IAM User Lifecycle Management | □ | |

### IAM Roles Implementation

List the IAM roles you've implemented and their purposes:

| Role Name | Trust Relationship | Attached Policies | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### IAM Groups Implementation

List the IAM groups you've implemented and their permissions:

| Group Name | Attached Policies | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### IAM Policies Implementation

List the custom IAM policies you've created:

| Policy Name | Policy Type | Key Permissions | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Open-Ended Reflection Questions

Take time to reflect on the following questions. Your answers will demonstrate your understanding of AWS identity and access management concepts and help build your GRC portfolio.

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege Implementation

How did you apply the principle of least privilege in your IAM implementation? What challenges did you encounter, and how did you address them?
