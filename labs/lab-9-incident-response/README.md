# Lab 9: Incident Response and Recovery

## Overview

This lab focuses on implementing a comprehensive incident response and recovery framework in AWS. You will learn how to prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents using AWS services and best practices. The lab covers incident response automation, forensics capabilities, and disaster recovery procedures.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Design and implement an incident response plan for AWS workloads
2. Set up automated incident detection and response mechanisms
3. Configure forensics capabilities and evidence collection
4. Implement automated containment and remediation procedures
5. Create and test disaster recovery procedures
6. Establish post-incident analysis and reporting processes

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have:

- An AWS account with administrative access
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Basic understanding of AWS security services
- Familiarity with incident response concepts
- Completed Lab 1: AWS Account Governance (recommended)
- Completed Lab 4: Security Monitoring and Logging (recommended)

## Estimated Time and Cost

- **Time to complete**: 4-5 hours
- **AWS cost**: $15-25 if resources are promptly cleaned up after the lab
  - Most resources are eligible for AWS Free Tier
  - Some services like AWS Config and GuardDuty will incur charges
  - Storage for forensics and backups will incur charges

## Architecture Overview

This lab will guide you through building an incident response framework that includes:

- Automated incident detection using AWS Security Hub and GuardDuty
- Incident response automation using EventBridge and Lambda
- Forensics capabilities with automated evidence collection
- Secure logging and audit trail maintenance
- Automated containment and remediation procedures
- Disaster recovery capabilities and procedures
- Post-incident analysis and reporting tools

See the [architecture diagram](architecture-diagram.md) for a visual representation of the solution.

## Modules

The lab is divided into five modules:

1. **Module 1: Incident Response Preparation** - Set up the incident response framework
   - Configure Security Hub and GuardDuty
   - Set up automated notifications
   - Create incident response runbooks
   - Establish forensics capabilities

2. **Module 2: Detection and Analysis** - Implement incident detection
   - Configure detection rules
   - Set up automated analysis
   - Create incident classification
   - Implement evidence collection

3. **Module 3: Containment and Eradication** - Automate incident response
   - Implement automated containment
   - Create remediation procedures
   - Set up isolation mechanisms
   - Configure cleanup processes

4. **Module 4: Recovery and Post-Incident** - Establish recovery procedures
   - Create recovery playbooks
   - Implement backup restoration
   - Set up post-incident analysis
   - Create reporting templates

5. **Module 5: Testing and Improvement** - Test and refine the framework
   - Conduct incident response exercises
   - Test recovery procedures
   - Evaluate response effectiveness
   - Implement improvements

Follow the [step-by-step guide](step-by-step-guide.md) to complete each module.

## Validation

After completing the lab, use the [validation checklist](validation-checklist.md) to verify your implementation meets all security requirements.

## Advanced Challenges

Once you've completed the main lab, try the [advanced challenges](challenges.md) to further enhance your skills.

## Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges, make sure to delete all resources created during this lab by following the cleanup instructions at the end of the step-by-step guide.
