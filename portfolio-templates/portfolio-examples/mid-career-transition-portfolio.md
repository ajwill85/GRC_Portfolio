## Career Transition Journey

### From Traditional Security to AWS Cloud

My career transition journey has involved:

1. **Building AWS Foundations**: Obtaining AWS certifications and hands-on experience with core security services
2. **Translating Skills**: Adapting traditional security controls to cloud-native implementations
3. **Learning Infrastructure as Code**: Moving from manual security configuration to automated deployments
4. **Implementing Continuous Compliance**: Transitioning from point-in-time assessments to continuous monitoring

Key learnings from this transition include the importance of automation, the shift from perimeter-based to identity-based security, and the power of infrastructure as code for security at scale.
