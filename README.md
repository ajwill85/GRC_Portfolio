## ⚠️ Disclaimers

1. This is a personal project and does not represent or reflect the views, opinions, or work of my current employer, Aquia, or any previous employers.

2. The code, configurations, and resources in this repository are for **educational purposes only**. While they demonstrate security concepts, they should not be used directly in production environments without proper review, testing, and customization for your specific security and compliance requirements.

## 🚀 Project Vision

This GRC Portfolio Hub is my initiative to empower Governance, Risk, and Compliance professionals in showcasing their practical AWS GRC engineering implementation skills. Drawing from my 15 years of cybersecurity experience and deep expertise in GRC Engineering, I've created this repository to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise by providing ready-to-deploy labs, comprehensive guidance, and a structured portfolio framework.

My mission is to create the industry's premier open-source resource for GRC professionals to demonstrate practical AWS GRC engineering skills through guided, hands-on experiences that directly align with employer needs and AWS best practices.
