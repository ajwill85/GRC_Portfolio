# Secure Data Platform Capstone Project

## Overview
Build a comprehensive data security platform that combines concepts from multiple labs to create a secure, scalable, and compliant data processing environment in AWS.

## Learning Objectives
1. Design and implement end-to-end data security
2. Apply multiple security controls in layers
3. Implement automated compliance monitoring
4. Create incident response procedures
5. Demonstrate security best practices

## Project Components

### 1. Infrastructure Security (Labs 1, 2, 8)
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Network segmentation and security groups
- AWS Organizations for multi-account management
- Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation

### 2. Identity Management (Labs 3, 7)
- IAM roles and policies using least privilege
- AWS SSO integration
- MFA enforcement
- Automated access reviews

### 3. Data Protection (Labs 5, 6)
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Key management using AWS KMS
- Secrets management
- Data classification and DLP

### 4. Monitoring and Response (Labs 4, 9)
- Security monitoring using GuardDuty
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Automated incident response
- Compliance reporting

### 5. Application Security (Labs 8, 10)
- WAF implementation
- API security
- Container security
- CI/CD security integration

## Implementation Steps

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   ```bash
   # Deploy base infrastructure
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name secure-data-platform \
     --template-body file://infrastructure/main.yaml
   ```

2. **Identity Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Configure AWS SSO
   aws sso-admin create-instance \
     --instance-arn arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. **Data Protection Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Create KMS keys
   aws kms create-key \
     --description "Data encryption key" \
     --policy file://policies/key-policy.json
   ```

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   ```bash
   # Enable GuardDuty
   aws guardduty create-detector \
     --enable \
     --data-sources S3Logs={Enable=true}
   ```

5. **Application Security**
   ```bash
   # Deploy WAF rules
   aws wafv2 create-web-acl \
     --name secure-data-platform \
     --scope REGIONAL \
     --default-action Block={} \
     --rules file://security/waf-rules.json
   ```
