# Advanced GRC Challenges

This directory contains advanced challenges that integrate multiple security domains and demonstrate comprehensive AWS security implementation skills. These challenges are designed for those who have completed the individual labs and are ready to tackle more complex, real-world scenarios.

## Challenge Types

### Multi-Lab Integration Challenges

These challenges require you to combine concepts and techniques from multiple labs to create integrated security solutions:

1. **Enterprise Security Framework** - Implement a comprehensive security framework spanning multiple AWS accounts
2. **Automated Security Posture Management** - Create an end-to-end solution for security posture management with automated remediation
3. **Least Privilege Access Implementation** - Build a sophisticated identity management solution with just-in-time access

### Capstone Projects

These larger projects simulate real-world GRC implementations that would be valuable additions to your portfolio:

1. **Financial Services Compliance Environment** - Build a PCI-DSS compliant environment for financial data processing
2. **Healthcare Data Security Framework** - Implement a HIPAA-compliant environment for healthcare data
3. **Government Security Baseline** - Create a FedRAMP Moderate compliant baseline for government workloads

## Challenge Structure

Each challenge includes:

- **Scenario Description** - The business context and requirements
- **Success Criteria** - Specific objectives that must be met
- **Architecture Guidance** - General architectural approach without specific implementation details
- **Validation Methods** - How to verify your implementation meets the requirements
- **Documentation Template** - Format for documenting your solution for your portfolio

## Using These Challenges in Your Portfolio

After completing a challenge:

1. Document your solution following the provided template
2. Include architecture diagrams showing your implementation
3. Discuss the security controls implemented and your rationale
4. Explain how your solution addresses specific compliance requirements
5. Add this documentation to your GRC portfolio

## Prerequisites

Before attempting these challenges, you should:

1. Complete at least 4-5 of the individual labs
2. Be comfortable with both CloudFormation and Terraform
3. Have a solid understanding of AWS security services
4. Be familiar with relevant compliance frameworks (PCI, HIPAA, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Review the challenges in the [multi-lab-challenges](multi-lab-challenges/) directory
2. Choose a challenge that aligns with your professional interests or career goals
3. Read the scenario and success criteria carefully
4. Plan your approach before beginning implementation
5. Use the provided template to document your solution
